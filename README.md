# Open-Source C-Library

- `cdll.h` is an implementation of a Circular Doubly Linked List data structure. It includes documentation at the top that explains how to use the library properly and how to customize it for your needs. Time and Space complexities for the algorithms are minimized to offer maximum performance.
- `GPF.h` contains the General Purpose Functions that are readily available for use in any of your programs. The flagship functions being readLine() which is a massive improvement from the C standard library's scanf(), and Memory Management functionality that abstracts away most, if not all, of the tedious memory deallocation using the `cdll.h` implementation.
- This library was used to develop a state-of-the-art `Circuit Simulator`, a program that is able to read a circuit from a text file, create an internal data structure that allows for maximum versatility, and offers multiple services including finding any unknown/variable logic gates as well as circuit minimization or reduction to improve the hardware's performance.
